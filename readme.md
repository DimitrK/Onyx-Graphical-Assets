# Onyx Graphical Assets #

This is a selection of icons for Onyx, the widget library for EnyoJS. This is an attempt to provide the community with a method of consistenty reproducing the interface icons that appear in many of the original Enyo 1.0 applications.

The Photoshop PSD is split into two parts - Light background and Dark background. There is a seperate set of layer styles for both types of background.

Each icon has a layer style applied which can be duplicated across layers or documents.

If you would like to request a particular icon, then please start an issue and I'll see what I can do.
